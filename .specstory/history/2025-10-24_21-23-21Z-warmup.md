I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase!

I can see you're in the `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch. I notice there are some modified files:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts`
- `src/ui/App.tsx`

I'm warmed up and ready to help with:
- **Glob searches** for finding files by pattern
- **Grep searches** for finding content with regex
- **File reading** to analyze specific files
- **Bash operations** for file exploration

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
