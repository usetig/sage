I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist equipped to:

- **Find files** using glob patterns across your repository
- **Search code** with powerful regex patterns through file contents
- **Read files** when you have specific paths in mind
- **Navigate directories** and understand your project structure

Your repository is at `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` and appears to be a Git project with recent activity on the main branch.

I can see you have uncommitted changes in:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts`
- `src/ui/App.tsx`

Just let me know what you'd like to explore or search for, and I'll help you navigate your codebase efficiently!
