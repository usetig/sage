I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase!

I can see you're in the `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch. There are currently some modified files:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts` (modified)
- `src/ui/App.tsx` (modified)

I'm equipped to help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Explore your project structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
