I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist for this Sage project.

I can see you're working in `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` - a git repository currently on the `main` branch. The project has recent changes including modifications to TypeScript config, package files, and the main App component, plus some new files in `src/lib/` and `src/types/`.

I'm equipped to:
- **Find files** using glob patterns across your codebase
- **Search contents** with regex patterns to locate specific code
- **Read files** when you know the exact path
- **Navigate directories** to understand project structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your Sage project?
