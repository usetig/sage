I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I can help you navigate and explore your codebase in `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage`.

Here's what I can do for you:

- **Search files with glob patterns** - Find files by name, extension, or path patterns
- **Search file contents with regex** - Find specific code or text within files
- **Read file contents** - View specific files you want to examine
- **Run bash commands** - List directories, check file stats, and other file operations

I see you're on the `main` branch of a git repository, with recent commits related to TUI setup and review functionality.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
