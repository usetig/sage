I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist. 

I can assist you with:
- **Glob patterns** - finding files by name and extension patterns
- **Grep searches** - searching file contents with regex
- **Read operations** - examining specific file contents
- **Bash operations** - listing directories, copying files, and other file operations

I see you're working in the `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` repository on the main branch. I notice you have some modified files:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts` (modified)
- `src/ui/App.tsx` (modified)

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
