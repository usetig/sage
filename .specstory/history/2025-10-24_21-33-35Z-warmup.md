I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for Anthropic's official CLI.

I'm equipped to:
- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search file contents** using regex patterns with grep
- **Read specific files** when you know the exact path
- **Run bash operations** for file listing and navigation

The repository is located at `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` and is a git repo on the main branch.

I can see there are currently some modified files:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts` (modified)
- `src/ui/App.tsx` (modified, staged)

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
