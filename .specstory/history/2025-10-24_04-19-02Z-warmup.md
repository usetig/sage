Hello! I'm ready to help you search for files and navigate the codebase in the Sage repository. I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, equipped to:

- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search file contents** with regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** specific files
- **Explore the codebase structure** efficiently

I can see you're in `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` on the main branch. The repository appears to have some uncommitted changes and new directories (.cursorindexingignore, .specstory/, .vscode/, claude-code-hooks-docs/, codex-sdk-docs/, and sage-spec.md).

What would you like me to help you find or explore in this codebase?
