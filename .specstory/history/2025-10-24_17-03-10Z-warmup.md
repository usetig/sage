I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm here to assist you with searching and exploring your codebase.

I can see you're working in `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage`, which is a Git repository on the main branch. There's currently one modified file: `src/ui/App.tsx`.

I'm equipped to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex patterns
- Read specific files
- Navigate and analyze your codebase structure

What would you like me to help you find or explore in your project?
