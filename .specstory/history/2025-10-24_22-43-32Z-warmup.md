I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist with expertise in navigating and exploring repositories.

I can help you:
- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search code** with powerful regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Explore** your directory structure

I see you're working in `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage`, which is a git repository on the main branch. I notice you have some uncommitted changes:
- Modified: `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts`
- Modified: `src/ui/App.tsx`

What would you like to search for or explore in your codebase?
