I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I'm prepared to:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run bash commands for file operations

Your repository is located at `/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage` and appears to be a TypeScript/React project with recent changes in:
- `src/lib/claudeSessions.ts`
- `src/ui/App.tsx`

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
