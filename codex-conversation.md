Repo Snapshot

Project docs (README.md:1) position Sage as a passive reviewer that mirrors Claude Code sessions; agents.md:1 expands the guardrails and workflow expectations.
The CLI entrypoint (src/index.tsx:1) boots the Ink application, while src/ui/App.tsx:1 manages session selection, continuous review mode, chokidar watching, queue processing, manual syncs, and clarification threads.
SpecStory integration (src/lib/specstory.ts:1) refreshes .sage/history, parses markdown exports, filters warmup-only sessions, and derives titles/timestamps for the picker.
Markdown parsing (src/lib/markdown.ts:1) extracts primary user/Claude turns, removing sidechains and interrupt artifacts; regression coverage lives in src/lib/markdown.test.ts:1.
Review orchestration (src/lib/review.ts:1) coordinates initial/incremental critiques, persists Codex threads via src/lib/threads.ts:1, and caches verdicts through src/lib/reviewsCache.ts:1.
Codex prompts (src/lib/codex.ts:1) enforce the structured schema, audience guidelines, and output fields; UI components (src/ui/CritiqueCard.tsx:1, src/ui/ClarificationCard.tsx:1, src/ui/Spinner.tsx:1) render critique cards, clarification exchanges, and status feedback.
Operational Notes

Sage auto-installs a Claude Stop hook (src/lib/hooks.ts:1) that runs specstory sync claude --output-dir .sage/history --no-version-check --silent --no-cloud-sync --no-usage-analytics from a sandboxed runner to keep exports fresh.
Debug mode helpers (src/lib/debug.ts:1) honor SAGE_DEBUG, always dump prompt/context artifacts under .debug/, and sanitize filenames for inspection.
Persistent state lives under .sage/ (threads/, history/, reviews/), enabling thread resumption, deduped critiques, and session cache replay; cleanup utilities guard against corruption.
Dependencies (package.json:1) lean on TypeScript, Ink/React, chokidar, and @openai/codex-sdk (model defaulted to gpt-5-codex), with scripts for npm start, npm run dev, and npm run build.
Additional validation targets prompt construction (src/lib/codex.test.ts:1), ensuring follow-up payloads stay consistent with initial review formatting.

Can you further research how the claude code logs are formatted and how they work? Create a document in @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/external-docs/claude-code-jsonl called 'claude-logs-information.md' that documents your findings


Added external-docs/claude-code-jsonl/claude-logs-information.md:1, summarizing where Claude Code JSONL transcripts live, key event types, schema fields, resume/warmup behavior, hook payload metadata, and parsing tips drawn from the bundled docs. No automated tests were run (documentation-only change). Consider wiring this into future tooling docs if you extend Sage’s session parsers.

did you actually look at the logs using tool calls?


No, I didn’t open actual Claude Code JSONL files during this task—I based the write‑up on the documentation that’s already checked into the repo (external-docs/claude-code-jsonl and the hook reference). If you’d like me to inspect live logs next, just point me at a sample file or directory.

Inspect the live logs in /Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage


Live Log Findings

Main transcript "/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage/ba93ece4-80ee-4f87-9b23-214d9e786827.jsonl":1-9 starts with a file-history-snapshot record, then alternates type:"user" and type:"assistant" lines that include sessionId, cwd, version, gitBranch, thinkingMetadata, and rich message payloads (text plus tool_use entries with usage stats and cache counters).
The same file emits consecutive type:"summary" records up front (`...ba93ece4-80ee-4f87-9b23-214d9e786827.jsonl":3-6), showing how the resume picker derives human titles.
Tool executions materialize as type:"user" entries carrying content:[{ "type":"tool_result", ... }], confirming the tool result handoff back into the primary stream (`...ba93ece4-80ee-4f87-9b23-214d9e786827.jsonl":9).
Sidechain work is broken out into per-agent logs such as "/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage/agent-ffdca2dd.jsonl":1-5, which mirror the parent session but mark isSidechain:true, add agentId, and capture every tool-use call (Read/Bash, etc.) the Explore subagent performed.
Warmup sessions appear exactly as expected: files like "/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage/073061c4-ad15-4c38-80bd-565435a74221.jsonl":1-2 begin with a type:"user" entry whose content is the literal "Warmup", followed immediately by a scripted assistant greeting—these are the auto-priming turns we filter out in Sage.
Several empty or near-empty transcripts exist (e.g., ab443b05-dcde-43e7-b19d-803582d4fa17.jsonl sized 0), which are safe to ignore but worth guarding against when parsing.
Let me know if you’d like deeper extraction (e.g., stitching multiple sessions, producing summaries, or indexing summary titles) from these live logs.

Update @claude-logs-information.md with your new findings


Added concrete observations from the live transcripts: noted the leading file-history-snapshot entry, new metadata fields (uuid, parentUuid, isSidechain, cache usage, etc.), the way tool results embed in type:"user" events, sidechain agent logs, warmup turn structure, zero-byte sessions, and cache counters (external-docs/claude-code-jsonl/claude-logs-information.md:9-75). No code changes beyond documentation; no tests required. Let me know if you want a parser added or summaries for other sessions.

Is @resume-behavior.md and @warmup.md still up to date? It looks like there was a recent claude code update that changed the jsonl behavior (specifically it looks like the sidechain logs are sotored in separate jsonl files with 'agent..' prefix).

For example, if you look in @/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-test-projects-t16-claude-code, you'll notice there are no 'agent..' jsonls.


Doc Refresh

Updated external-docs/claude-code-jsonl/resume-behavior.md:27,192 to note the 2.0.24+ change where Claude Code writes sidechain transcripts to agent-*.jsonl, while older logs (e.g., 2.0.13) inline them.
Added the same version-aware warning to external-docs/claude-code-jsonl/warmup.md:12 so warmup filters cover both main and agent logs.
Both guides now flag the divergent log layouts, so they stay accurate across Claude Code releases. No tests required.

Did you actually inspect the differences?


Yes. I listed both project directories and sampled their transcripts:

The Sage project (/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage) clearly contains agent-*.jsonl files—see the directory listing and sample entries with isSidechain:true, agentId, and standalone tool-use logs.
The t16 test project (/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-test-projects-t16-claude-code) has only the main <uuid>.jsonl files and embeds Explore/Edit tool turns directly inside the primary session (no companion agent-… files).
Those spot checks are what drove the doc updates about version-dependent behavior.

Can you tell me what happens when I resume a conversation, in terms of the logs


When you run claude --resume (or pick a session in the UI), Claude loads the prior context but starts a new JSONL file in the same project directory. The important behaviors:

New Session File

A fresh UUID file appears under ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/.
The first entries are usually a file-history-snapshot, then your resume prompt and Claude’s reply.
Older content stays in the original transcript; nothing is appended retroactively.
Summary Titles

The resume picker still shows one “conversation” because it groups by project/branch and the latest summary titles. If a new summary hasn’t been emitted yet, it reuses the previous one.
Sidechain Logs

Recent builds (≈2.0.24+) write delegated agent work to separate agent-<id>.jsonl files alongside the new session. Older builds embed those tool calls directly in the main log. Expect both patterns if you keep long-term history.
Thread Chaining

There’s no official cross-file conversation ID. To stitch sessions, you have to infer a chain (same project directory plus matching titles, branch, timestamps, etc.).
So each resume gives you a new “leaf” file (and possibly new agent logs) while the UI makes it feel continuous.

Read @/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage-1/99a2b4b2-adfe-48cb-b667-952388d564d1.jsonl

I resumed this conversation right before the prompt 'Good to hear!'

As you can see, the old content is still in this log. so "Older content stays in the original transcript; nothing is appended retroactively." might be incorrect


You’re absolutely right—the new session file is seeded with the earlier conversation. In …/sage-1/99a2b4b2-adfe-48cb-b667-952388d564d1.jsonl, lines 5–11 reproduce the pre-resume exchange (note how the copied entries still carry the original sessionId 86b3ff8e-d924-40f9-b405-a068b3b85411), and only after that do you see the truly new turn “Good to hear!” (line 12) plus its reply (line 13) under the new session UUID. The original transcript (86b3ff8e-…) remains unchanged, but the resumed file starts life as a cloned copy and then appends fresh events. I’ve updated the docs to reflect this duplication so tooling knows to dedupe overlapping history.

I had claude code do an investigation as well. It saved its findings in @/tmp/comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md. Is there anything it found that you didnt? Does your understanding align with claude's? Did claude make any mistakes?


Alignment

Claude’s write-up matches what we’ve been seeing on disk: logs live under ~/.claude/projects/<project slug>/, sidechain work for 2.0.24+ lives in agent-*.jsonl, warmup files are tiny isSidechain:true stubs, and each resume spins up a new transcript. Their field inventory (uuid, parentUuid, thinkingMetadata, requestId, etc.) lines up with the data I pulled from the same files.
Where we now diverge

The doc stops short of describing what actually happens during resume: it says a new <new-uuid>.jsonl file is created, but it doesn’t mention that Claude copies the entire prior conversation into that new file before appending fresh turns. The transcript you pointed to (…/sage-1/99a2b4b2-adfe-48cb-b667-952388d564d1.jsonl) shows that duplication clearly, so any tooling has to dedupe by uuid/timestamp instead of assuming the new file only contains new turns.
It treats the “modern” format as the only one Sage needs. We still encounter 2.0.13-era logs (all events inline, no agent-*.jsonl), so the parser path needs to remain defensive. We updated the docs to call out both shapes.
New takeaways from Claude’s run

They catalogued every event type into tables and spelled out fuller schemas for user, assistant, summary, etc. That’s useful confirmation and adds structure we hadn’t written down yet.
The doc emphasizes the architectural upside of parsing JSONL directly (vs. SpecStory). That’s strategic guidance rather than a format finding, but it’s worth considering.
Mistakes

Aside from the missing resume-duplication note (now fixed in our docs), I didn’t spot factual errors. The “modern only” stance just needs softening so readers know historical logs still exist.
Net: our understanding and Claude’s are largely aligned; we simply had to tighten the resume section and make the version story explicit.

"It treats the “modern” format as the only one Sage needs."

this is expected. We will require users to upgrade to the latest claude version. For now, we will only support the new claude version.

Can you update the document with the additinoal resume information you mentioned? I moved the doc to @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/documentation/claude-code-jsonl/comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md


Integrated the resume behavior findings into documentation/claude-code-jsonl/comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md:68, clarifying that a resumed session creates a new JSONL file seeded with the prior transcript (and thus contains duplicate uuid/timestamp pairs that downstream tooling must dedupe). Let me know if you want an example snippet or parser guidance added next.

Now that you have context on how the jsonl works. Would you recommend switching from specstory to our own extractor?


Given what we’ve just confirmed about the JSONL logs, I’d recommend planning a switch to a native extractor—just do it deliberately rather than as a rushed flip.

Why it’s worth moving

Real-time access: SpecStory adds an extra CLI hop plus file writes; parsing JSONL directly lets Sage react as soon as Claude finishes a turn.
Fewer moving parts: Dropping SpecStory removes an external dependency, CLI upgrades, and markdown conversions (which also lose sidechain/tool detail).
Complete data: Agent files, token usage, cache stats, metadata—all immediately available for richer critiques or future analytics.
What to watch

Backfill strategy: Once we depend on JSONL, sessions must live at ~/.claude/projects/...; add a migration note for users who’d been relying on SpecStory exports.
Resume dedupe: Resumed sessions clone prior turns. Our parser has to collapse duplicated uuids/timestamps so review queues don’t double-fire.
Version gate: Require Claude Code ≥2.0.24 explicitly in Sage (ideally a startup check) so we don’t break on older “all-in-one-file” logs.
Warmup filtering & agent globbing: replicate the warmup skip and sidechain handling we just documented before cutting over.
Suggested path

Build the JSONL ingestion behind a feature flag and run it in parallel with SpecStory (dry-run mode) to compare outputs.
Once critiques match and dedupe logic is solid, flip the default and keep SpecStory as an optional fallback for a release or two.
Update install docs and prompts to call out the new Claude version requirement.
So: yes, move to an in-house extractor—but land it with a phased rollout and the safeguards above to avoid disrupting current users.

We have no users and we havent launched yet, so having a backfill strategy is not necessary


Right, if we’re pre-launch there’s no backfill pressure. That makes the switch even more attractive—you can drop SpecStory entirely and ship the JSONL path as the only ingestion once it’s stable. Still worth keeping the other guardrails (version check, resume dedupe, warmup filtering), but you won’t need a dual pipeline or migration script.

Is it even necessary to implement a resume dedupe?

Here's what im thinking,
refactor sage to only look at currently open claude sessions. I'm im not entirely sure how we could do this, but one idea would be to add a claude hook that udpated some local state with the path to the jsonl log, and when the session is closed we remove that local state.

since claude hooks pass in the path to the jsonl for that message, we would only have to reference that jsonl.

For detecting what was already reviewed, we could just look at the last prompt in the json at .sage/reviews

what do you think?


Not a full-blown “dedupe pipeline”, but we still need a lightweight guard. When Claude resumes it copies the earlier turns verbatim (same uuid/prompt text) into the new JSONL, so if we ingest the whole file we’ll re-review those unless we remember what we’ve already critiqued. Luckily we already persist per-session caches under .sage/reviews/… with the last turn signature; we just need to lean on that:

Store the uuid (or hashed prompt) of the last user turn we reviewed in the cache.
When parsing the JSONL, skip turns whose uuid matches that checkpoint.
Process only the entries after it. Resumes won’t trigger any extra work, because the cloned history stops at the cached uuid and only the new turn remains.
That’s the minimal “dedupe” we need—no extra data structures, just honoring the existing cache marker.

On the “open sessions only” idea: a Stop hook could write the active transcript path into a small state file, and TUI could poll that list instead of globbing history. That would keep Sage focused on live conversations, but we still have to:

Handle multiple simultaneous sessions (e.g. the user jumps between tabs).
Deal with the “resume = new file” pattern. The hook will hand us the new path, but the file includes prior turns, so we still rely on the cached last-uuid to know where to resume.
So, yes, track active sessions via hooks if it simplifies discovery, but don’t drop the cached-turn checkpoint—that’s the only thing preventing resumed files from retriggering old critiques.

"On the “open sessions only” idea: a Stop hook could write the active transcript path into a small state file, and TUI could poll that list instead of globbing history. "

Wouldnt it need to be a SessionStart hook -> writes the active transcript path

SessionEnd hook -> deletes the active transcript path


Exactly—SessionStart is the clean hook for “this transcript just went live”, so you’d append the transcript_path (and maybe a friendly label) to your active-session registry there, and SessionEnd can remove it when the user exits. You’d still keep the Stop hook around to tap new turns and kick reviews, but SessionStart/SessionEnd give you definitive open/close boundaries. A couple of guardrails to bake in:

SessionStart fires even when you resume, so make sure you overwrite any stale entry for that session ID.
SessionEnd can fail to run if Claude crashes or the editor force-quits; a periodic sanity check (e.g., culling entries whose JSONLs haven’t changed in X minutes) keeps the list tidy.
If users open multiple Claude windows, you’ll see concurrent SessionStart events; store entries keyed by session_id so you don’t clobber anything.
With those in place, the TUI can read a single state file instead of globbing the entire history directory.

We would also need to consider compactions and make sure it doesnt break our system. I just compacted the conversation at @/Users/henryquillin/.claude/projects/-Users-henryquillin-Desktop-Repos-sage/ba93ece4-80ee-4f87-9b23-214d9e786827.jsonl

Inspect the file and update @comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md with a section about how compactions work


Compaction Notes

Documented how manual/auto /compact events surface in the logs (documentation/claude-code-jsonl/comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md:67), including the appended isCompactSummary:true entry and isMeta:true command wrappers.
Called out that these should be ignored for critique purposes and that SessionStart/SessionEnd hooks with matcher compact can be used when maintaining active-session state.

Does this affect sage at all ?


Compaction doesn’t break Sage, but it does add a few “noise” records to the tail of the transcript:

You’ll see a user entry with isCompactSummary: true that holds the auto-generated recap.
Immediately around it are isMeta: true lines reflecting the /compact command and its stdout.
Session hooks report the event with matcher compact.
As long as our ingestion treats isCompactSummary/isMeta as metadata (skip them when looking for the next real user prompt), nothing else changes: the conversation history is still intact and future turns append normally. If we leave SpecStory in place, it already ignores these because the markdown export doesn’t surface them; once we move to native JSONL parsing we just need to filter them out before queuing a review.

Now can you get context on how hooks work. Read @hooks-reference.md and check out some of the sources in @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/external-docs/claude-code-hooks-docs/claude-code-hook-helpful-resources

Think about what information we could extract from the hook itself without having to parse the jsonl log


Hooks already hand us a lot of structured metadata before we ever touch the JSONL:

Shared payload — Every hook delivers session_id, transcript_path, cwd, and the current permission_mode (default, plan, acceptEdits, bypassPermissions) along with hook_event_name (external-docs/claude-code-hooks-docs/hooks-reference.md:278-288). That alone lets us map the active transcript to a project directory and capture Claude’s trust mode.

Tool activity — PreToolUse/PostToolUse add tool_name, the exact tool_input, and (post) the tool_response, which includes file paths, command arguments, etc. (hooks-reference.md:295-330). We can audit edits, reads, and Task calls straight from the hook without re-reading the transcript.

User interaction — UserPromptSubmit provides the raw prompt text (hooks-reference.md:346-356), so we can store what the developer asked before the JSONL is even touched. Notifications expose Claude’s UI warnings and permission requests (hooks-reference.md:333-344).

Turn completion — Stop/SubagentStop events signal when Claude (or a subagent) finishes. The payload includes stop_hook_active, so we can detect re-entrant runs (hooks-reference.md:359-372).

Compaction — PreCompact tells us whether the compact came from /compact or auto-trigger, plus any custom instructions (hooks-reference.md:375-388). That lets us flag that the next turns may include compaction summaries and avoid misinterpreting them.

Session lifecycle — SessionStart reports why the session opened (source: startup|resume|clear|compact) and gives us access to CLAUDE_ENV_FILE for persisted env vars (hooks-reference.md:202-218, 392-400). SessionEnd reports why it closed (reason: clear|logout|prompt_input_exit|other), ideal for cleaning active-session state (hooks-reference.md:260-270, 403-413).

Environment context — Hooks run with CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR set; plugin hooks also expose ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}. That’s enough to look up project config or stash state alongside the repo.

I skimmed the local “helpful resources” list (external-docs/claude-code-hooks-docs/claude-code-hook-helpful-resources) which points to the upstream docs/blog posts—they’ll give deeper examples if we need them later, but I didn’t fetch the remote URLs due to the offline environment.

Bottom line: for anything involving session bookkeeping, tool activity, or user prompts, the hook payload already has the data. We still need JSONL parsing to read Claude’s reply text, but we can trim a lot of filesystem scanning and state derivation just by wiring into SessionStart/SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop.

I gave you web access


Here’s what the external resources say (beyond the repo copies), and what they imply for Sage:

Hook Payload & Capabilities

The official Hooks reference clarifies the shared fields every hook receives—session_id, transcript_path, cwd, permission_mode, and hook_event_name—plus event-specific extras like tool parameters/results, compaction triggers, and stop status (docs.claude.com › hooks).
The same reference details hook outputs: exit code 0 to proceed, 2 to block, optional JSON responses for richer feedback, and how stdout/stderr are surfaced.
Sections on Hook Execution Details and Security Considerations outline runtime behavior (parallel execution, 60‑second default timeout, deduplication) and best practices.
Practical Workflow Guidance

The Get started with hooks guide walks through creating and testing hooks, stressing the quick “verify, then test” loop and listing turnkey examples (code formatting, file protection, custom notifications).
Anthropic’s settings and terminal configuration docs show how hooks slot into .claude/settings*.json and how custom notification hooks can integrate with terminal tooling.
Permissions & IAM

The IAM article describes using hooks to enforce extra permission checks (e.g., requiring external approval before a tool runs) and how managed policies interact with project/local settings.
Permission mode (default, plan, acceptEdits, bypassPermissions) is captured in the hook payload, so we always know the trust level when the event fired.
Plugins & Ecosystem

Plugin references explain that plugins can ship hooks alongside their own code, using ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} and running in parallel with user hooks—useful if we want Sage to coexist with user-installed plugins.
Community posts (GitButler, CometAPI, Apidog, Builder.io) add real-world patterns—automated workflow triggers, observability hooks, and guardrail examples.
Data We Can Capture Directly From Hooks (No JSONL Parse Needed)
Active Transcript Metadata

session_id and transcript_path tell us which JSONL to watch.
cwd, gitBranch (in some events), and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR give project context.
Lifecycle & Presence

SessionStart/SessionEnd events (with source/reason) let us track open sessions, resumes, clears, and compactions in real time.
We can maintain an “active sessions” registry strictly from hooks.
Prompt Capture

UserPromptSubmit provides the raw prompt text before Claude responds.
Tool Activity

PreToolUse/PostToolUse deliver structured tool inputs/outputs, so we can audit edits, commands, reads, and Task requests immediately.
Stop/SubagentStop signal completion and flip stop_hook_active when re-entered.
Permission Context

Every hook includes permission_mode; IAM docs confirm we can enforce stricter policies based on this without inspecting the transcript.
Compaction Events

PreCompact tells us when /compact (manual or auto) is about to run, so we can expect synthetic summary entries and avoid misclassifying them.
Notifications & Environment

Notification events surface Claude’s permission prompts, idle warnings, or custom notifications (useful for alerting in Sage).
CLAUDE_ENV_FILE (SessionStart only) lets us persist per-session env vars if we need to coordinate with external scripts.
Takeaways for Sage
We can slim down JSONL parsing to only what hooks can’t provide (Claude’s response text, sidechain summaries) while relying on hooks for session discovery, prompt capture, and tool auditing.
A small hook-runner can maintain the active session list, note permission mode changes, and record last prompt/turn without touching the transcript until it’s time to critique.
When we build the native JSONL ingest, we should treat hook events as the canonical change stream and only fall back to file diffing for the actual assistant reply content.
which hooks would we actually need to use?


We only need a handful of hooks to power Sage’s ingestion loop; the rest add noise we don’t act on:

SessionStart – Capture the transcript_path, session UUID, and reason (startup, resume, compact, etc.) the moment a session opens. This lets us maintain the “active sessions” registry without scanning .sage/history/.

SessionEnd – Drop the session from that registry and note why it ended (clear, logout, prompt_input_exit). If we persist state (last reviewed turn, cache path), this is the clean place to flush it.

Stop – Fires when Claude finishes its turn. It gives us both the session ID and a guarantee that the transcript now contains a complete assistant reply. That’s the trigger for queuing a review job.

UserPromptSubmit (optional but useful) – Records the raw user prompt before Claude responds, so we can log or cache the exact text without re-parsing the JSONL. This also helps with warmup detection and ensuring we only critique the turns we care about.

PreCompact (optional defensive hook) – Lets us flag compaction cycles (manual vs auto) so we can ignore the synthetic summary lines (isCompactSummary) that follow. Not strictly required, but helpful if we want to avoid false positives after a /compact.

Everything else—PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, etc.—provides richer telemetry (tool inputs/outputs, permission prompts), but Sage doesn’t need them to decide when to review. We can always add them later if we want deeper observability (e.g., auditing edits), but the core loop only relies on the five above.

Can you create a detailed implementation plan for switching from specstory to hooks and jsonl


Goal
Replace SpecStory-based ingestion with a hook-driven JSONL pipeline so Sage reviews live Claude sessions without external CLIs.

Phase 0 – Prep & Guardrails

Add a version check on startup: require Claude Code ≥2.0.24 (separate agent-*.jsonl).
Introduce a feature flag (SAGE_USE_JSONL) so we can ship the new path incrementally.
Document new requirements in README / troubleshooting (no SpecStory install needed).
Phase 1 – Hook Infrastructure

Hook command (.claude/settings.local.json):
Register SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop, UserPromptSubmit (optional: PreCompact).
The command runs a small Node/TS shim in our repo (src/hooks/sageHook.ts).
Pass hook payload (stdin JSON) to the shim; it writes to .sage/runtime/hooks-events.jsonl (append-only) or individual files per session.
Shim responsibilities:
Normalize payload, add timestamp.
Maintain active_sessions.json (map from session_id→{transcript_path, cwd, permission_mode, last_prompt}); SessionStart adds/updates, SessionEnd removes.
For Stop, append a “review queued” marker (with session ID) into .sage/runtime/review-queue.jsonl.
For UserPromptSubmit, update last_prompt for that session.
For PreCompact, mark the session as “compaction pending” so we skip synthetic turns.
Ensure writes are atomic (use fs.appendFile + fsync or write temp/rename).
Log errors to .sage/runtime/hook-errors.log.
Phase 2 – JSONL Parser Module

Build src/lib/jsonl.ts with:
listActiveSessions() pulling from active_sessions.json.
readTranscript(transcriptPath) streaming finite lines.
extractTurns(jsonLines, options) returning ordered TurnSummary[], honoring:
Skip entries flagged isCompactSummary/isMeta.
Deduplicate using cached lastReviewedUuid from .sage/reviews/(sessionId).json.
Warmup detection: skip sessions whose first user prompt = "Warmup".
getLatestTurnSignature(turn) generating stable hash from user prompt + assistant uuid.
Include helper to fetch agent-*.jsonl if we later want sidechain data (but not required for MVP).
Phase 3 – Application Changes

Session discovery (src/ui/App.tsx)
Under feature flag, source sessions from listActiveSessions() rather than globbing .sage/history.
Display session title based on latest last_prompt / summary from JSONL.
Queue processing
Replace chokidar on .sage/history with a watcher on .sage/runtime/review-queue.jsonl (or poll).
When a Stop hook fires, read queue entry, load transcript via jsonl.ts, compute new turns past lastReviewedUuid, queue review job.
Review orchestration (src/lib/review.ts)
Swap SpecStory parsing with jsonl.extractTurns() (respecting dedupe).
Persist lastReviewedUuid (and optional lastReviewedTimestamp) back into .sage/reviews/<session>.json.
Debug artifacts
Continue writing prompt/context under .debug/ using JSONL-sourced content.
Phase 4 – Housekeeping

Remove SpecStory integration: delete src/lib/specstory.ts, markdown parser, hooks.ts stop hook, and npm instructions once flag flips.
Update documentation: what-is-sage.md, agents.md, README; new troubleshooting (e.g., “hooks not firing”).
Provide migration script to clean .claude/settings.local.json (replace old Stop hook with new multi-hook config).
Optional: CLI command (npm run sage:init-hooks) that installs the hook JSON automatically.
Testing & Rollout

Unit tests for jsonl.extractTurns() (warmup, resume dupes, compaction noise).
Integration test that simulates hook event stream and ensures reviews enqueue exactly once per turn.
Manual smoke test with live Claude session: start, resume, compact, stop; confirm Sage picks up prompts, stays in sync.
Ship behind feature flag; gather feedback; remove SpecStory path once stable.
Key Risks & Mitigations

Hook failures: ensure shim handles partial writes + retries; surface errors in UI.
Resume duplication: rely on cached lastReviewedUuid to skip historical turns.
Hook install drift: provide command to re-install configuration and detect missing hooks at startup.
Concurrent sessions: active_sessions map must allow multiple entries; App should let user select among them.
"Introduce a feature flag (SAGE_USE_JSONL) so we can ship the new path incrementally." Dont do this. We can always git revert. This will just make things more complicated


Understood—we’ll commit to a straight cut-over without a feature flag. I’ll treat the JSONL pipeline as the new default path (with a note that we can revert if needed) and keep the rest of the plan intact.

Is there a better way to pass information from the hooks to sage besides using a file watcher?


A file append + watcher works, but there are nicer handshakes that keep Sage in sync without tailing:

1. Local HTTP endpoint (simplest IPC)

When Sage boots it opens an HTTP listener on 127.0.0.1:<port> (or a Unix socket).
It writes the chosen port/socket path to something stable like .sage/runtime/ipc.json.
The hook command reads that file and curl -sSf (or a tiny Node program) the JSON payload straight to the server.
Sage gets the hook event immediately; no filesystem polling, and the hook gets a synchronous 2xx/5xx answer.
If Sage isn’t running, the POST fails quickly, which is the same behavior we’d have if we appended to a file Sage isn’t watching.
2. Unix domain socket / named pipe

Same idea, but use net.createServer() on a socket path (e.g., /tmp/sage-hook.sock).
Hook script uses Node or socat to write the payload to the socket.
Fewer moving parts than HTTP, still zero file watching.
3. CLI forwarder process

The hook invokes node dist/hook-forwarder.js which tries to send the JSON to a live socket/HTTP endpoint and exits. That keeps the hook command trivial and lets us evolve the transport later.
All three avoid watching files; they do require Sage to create the IPC endpoint on startup and the hook shim to fall back gracefully if it can’t connect (maybe log to a fallback file). Among them, a localhost HTTP POST is usually the least friction: every environment has curl, it’s easy to debug, and we can still persist to disk if the POST fails.

Which approach would you recommend (inlcuding the file watcher approach)


I’d go with a tiny local HTTP endpoint (or Unix-domain socket) instead of the file-watcher pipeline:

File watcher (current idea)

✅ Simple to append.
❌ Requires tailing/locking, multi-writer care, potential missed events if the watcher goes down; harder to guarantee “exactly once” semantics.
Unix socket / HTTP listener (preferred)

✅ Hooks send each payload directly to Sage; no polling, instant delivery, no intermediate files.
✅ Easy ack/err handling—hook gets a status code.
✅ Lower risk of duplicate processing and simpler backpressure logic.
❌ Need to start the listener when Sage boots and handle the “Sage isn’t running” failure case (log/ignore).
Between HTTP and Unix sockets, HTTP is usually the most portable (every system has curl/Node available), so I’d implement that first. If the POST fails because Sage is down, we can log to a fallback file, but in the steady state we get clean, realtime, no-watchers event delivery.

Would we have to run the server in a separate terminal?


No extra terminal needed—the plan is to spin up the listener inside the Sage process itself. When you run npm start, Sage can bind a local HTTP (or Unix-socket) endpoint before rendering the TUI, then accept hook POSTs in the background. If the process isn’t running the hook will fail fast (which is fine—we can log the miss), but there’s no separate daemon to manage.

Here's what claude said :

No, but actually—now that I think about it more carefully—the file-based approach
is better for Sage than the HTTP endpoint I just recommended.

Here's why:

Sage's Usage Pattern

Sage isn't a long-running daemon that's always on. Users:

Work in Claude Code (hooks fire as they code)
Eventually start Sage to review sessions
Review, then exit Sage
With an HTTP endpoint:

❌ Hooks would fail when Sage isn't running (which is most of the time)
❌ We'd need fallback file writing anyway
❌ Two code paths to maintain
With signal files:

✅ Hooks fire at any time → write signal files
✅ Sage catches up when started (reads existing signals)
✅ While running, Sage watches for new signals in real-time
✅ One code path, naturally persistent
The Right File-Based Design

Using the directory-of-signal-files pattern I suggested earlier:

// Hook shim writes (no Sage process required)
fs.writeFileSync(
.sage/runtime/needs-review/${sessionId},
JSON.stringify({ transcriptPath, timestamp: Date.now() })
);

// Sage on startup (catch up on missed reviews)
const pending = fs.readdirSync('.sage/runtime/needs-review/');
for (const sessionId of pending) {
await processReview(sessionId);
fs.unlinkSync(.sage/runtime/needs-review/${sessionId});
}

// Sage while running (real-time)
chokidar.watch('.sage/runtime/needs-review/')
.on('add', async (filePath) => {
const sessionId = path.basename(filePath);
await processReview(sessionId);
fs.unlinkSync(filePath);
});

This isn't "file tailing" (inefficient)—it's event-driven file signals
(efficient). The watcher uses OS-level inotify/kqueue, so it's instant and
low-overhead.

Verdict

Stick with the file-based approach. It's simpler, matches Sage's intermittent
usage pattern, and doesn't require Sage to be running when Claude Code is active.
The HTTP endpoint idea only makes sense for always-on daemons, which Sage isn't.

=

what do you think?


Claude’s take is persuasive. Sage isn’t a resident daemon; most hooks fire while Sage is closed. With an HTTP socket we’d be in the awkward position of telling users “keep Sage running all day,” or else building the same file fallback for missed events. The signal-file queue gives us durability for free: hooks always succeed, Sage can drain backlog on startup, and while it’s running chokidar delivers “add” events instantly.

A few safeguards to keep it solid:

Write atomically (fs.writeFileSync with flag: 'wx' or write temp→rename) so partial JSON doesn’t appear.
Include a timestamp and maybe a monotonic counter so we can sort backlog before processing.
Make the watcher idempotent—if Sage crashes mid-review we can leave the marker in place and retry on restart.
Periodically clean up stale markers (e.g., if a file lingers after repeated failures, log it and move on).
Overall, a directory of per-session signal files lined up with Sage’s intermittent usage better than an always-on socket. Let’s commit to the file-based queue.

Ok. Create a detailed implementation plan in @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/documentation/specs


Created documentation/specs/jsonl-hooks-migration.md outlining the full hook + JSONL migration plan, including architecture, phased tasks, validation, and risks so we can execute the switch cleanly.

Do we really need the precompact hook?


We can skip it. PreCompact is handy but not essential—compaction already surfaces in the transcript (isCompactSummary/isMeta entries), and SessionStart fires with source:"compact" if the user runs /compact. Since our parser ignores those synthetic lines, we don’t need a dedicated hook. We can always add it later if we want to log manual vs auto compactions, but it’s not required for the migration plan.

Remove it from the plan


Updated documentation/specs/jsonl-hooks-migration.md to drop the PreCompact hook: plan now uses only SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop, and UserPromptSubmit; removed related state (compactPending) and simplified the JSONL extractor signature accordingly.

Why do we need to store 'permissionMode"?


We don’t strictly need to persist permissionMode for the JSONL migration—it’s not required to discover sessions or queue reviews. I included it because the hook payload hands it to us for free, and it could be useful later (e.g., logging when Claude enters plan or bypassPermissions mode, diagnosing denied tool calls). If you don’t see an immediate use, we can drop it from the stored state and reintroduce it later if a feature needs it; the core ingestion works fine without it.

lets drop it for now. Update the plan


Dropped permissionMode from the stored active-session state in documentation/specs/jsonl-hooks-migration.md, keeping the plan focused on just transcript path, cwd, and latest prompt metadata for now.

I had claude review your plan. Is any of this actually valid?

I'll review this systematically, looking for issues, gaps, and improvements.

⏺ Phase 1 Issues (Hook Runner)

Critical: Concurrent Write Safety

The plan has active-sessions.json as a single shared file that all hooks
read-modify-write:

// Hook fires → read entire file → modify → write back
const sessions = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('active-sessions.json'));
sessions[sessionId] = { ... };
fs.writeFileSync('active-sessions.json', JSON.stringify(sessions));

Problem: If two hooks fire simultaneously (e.g., Stop + UserPromptSubmit), you get
a race condition—one write clobbers the other.

Fix: Use one file per session instead:
.sage/runtime/sessions/{sessionId}.json # individual session metadata
.sage/runtime/needs-review/{sessionId} # review signal (already planned)

Now each hook only touches its own session file—no read-modify-write races.

Build Requirement Missing

The hook command references dist/hooks/sage-hook.js (compiled JS), but the plan
doesn't specify:

When/how users build this
What happens if they run configure-hooks before building
Whether we should use tsx instead to run TS directly (simpler, slightly slower)
Recommendation: Either:

Document npm run build as a prerequisite in the install script
Or use npx tsx src/hooks/sageHook.ts to avoid the build step entirely
Hook Payload Validation

What if Claude Code changes the hook schema in a future version? The shim should:

Validate required fields exist
Log a warning (not crash) if unexpected fields appear
Gracefully skip events it doesn't understand
⏺ Phase 2 Issues (JSONL Module)

Warmup Detection Placement

The spec says extractTurns filters warmup sessions:
extractTurns({ transcriptPath, lastReviewedUuid }) {
// Filter warmup sessions (first user prompt equals "Warmup")
}

Problem: This is too late—you've already read the file. Better to detect warmups
during session discovery and never show them in the UI at all.

Fix: Add isWarmupSession(transcriptPath) helper that checks just the first user
prompt, then filter at the listActiveSessions() level.

Agent File Ambiguity

The plan says "optionally expose agent file references for future use" but doesn't
clarify:

Are we reading agent-*.jsonl files in this implementation?
If not, why mention it?
Clarification needed: Earlier we decided to skip agent files entirely (only read
main session). The plan should explicitly state: "Agent files are ignored in this
implementation; sidechain transcripts are not reviewed."

Missing: Session Title Generation

SpecStory probably provided some kind of title/summary for each session. How do we
display sessions in the UI now? Options:

Use lastPrompt from UserPromptSubmit hook (most recent user message)
Use first non-warmup prompt
Generate a summary from the first turn
Recommendation: Use lastPrompt for simplicity—it's already captured by the hook.

⏺ Phase 3 Issues (Runtime Changes)

Race Condition: Startup Drain vs Live Hooks

The plan says:

On mount, drain .sage/runtime/needs-review/
Initialize chokidar watcher
Problem: If a hook fires between steps 1-2, you might miss it OR process it twice.

Fix: Start the watcher before draining, then ignore events for files you've
already processed:
const processed = new Set();

// Start watcher first
watcher.on('add', (path) => {
if (!processed.has(path)) handleReview(path);
});

// Then drain backlog
for (const file of fs.readdirSync(needsReviewDir)) {
processed.add(file);
await handleReview(file);
}

Signal File Lifecycle

The plan doesn't explicitly state: Who deletes the signal files?

The earlier discussion mentions fs.unlinkSync after processing, but the spec
should be explicit:

Sage deletes the signal file after successfully writing lastReviewedUuid to
cache
If review fails (error, crash), signal stays → retry on next startup
Error Handling Gaps

What if:

JSONL file is corrupted? → Skip with warning in UI, delete signal file
Session deleted mid-review? → Catch ENOENT, delete signal file
Transcript path in session metadata doesn't exist? → Warn, delete stale session
metadata
These should be in the spec.

.sage/history/ Reference

The spec mentions "adapt to session metadata from JSONL rather than
.sage/history/" but I don't see where .sage/history/ comes from. Is this:

Where SpecStory currently stores output?
A typo?
Needs clarification from the existing codebase.

⏺ Search(pattern: ".sage/history")
⎿ Found 15 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: ".sage/history", path: "src", output_mode: "content")
⎿ Found 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Got it—.sage/history/ is where SpecStory outputs markdown files. The spec is
correct: we're replacing that entire directory with direct JSONL reads.

⏺ Missing Pieces & Edge Cases

Multi-Project Support
Current Sage behavior: does it support multiple Claude projects? If yes:

Each project needs its own .sage/runtime/ directory
Hook shim needs to know which project it's running in (use $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR)
The spec doesn't address this.

Hook Installation Path
.claude/settings.local.json lives in the user's home directory (~/.claude/), not
in the project. The hook command needs to reference the Sage installation path,
which varies by user. Options:

Absolute path: /Users/alice/code/sage/dist/hooks/sage-hook.js ❌ (not portable)
Relative to project: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/node_modules/sage/... ❌ (only works if
Sage is npm-installed in project)
Global install: Sage CLI tool installed globally, hooks reference global binary
✅
This needs a concrete answer: How is Sage installed/distributed? Is it:

An npm package users install per-project?
A global CLI tool?
A repo users clone and run locally?
Migration from SpecStory
Users who currently have:

Existing .sage/history/ markdown files
Existing .sage/reviews/{sessionId}.json caches
Do these "just work" with the new system? Or do review UUIDs differ between
markdown and JSONL?

Recommendation: Document that after migration, old sessions won't be discovered
(markdown files are ignored), but existing review caches are compatible (UUIDs
match).

Partial Review State
Scenario:

Hook fires → writes signal file
Sage starts review → writes partial data to .sage/reviews/{sessionId}.json
Sage crashes
Signal file still exists → on restart, processes again
If lastReviewedUuid was partially written, the second pass might skip turns that
were never actually reviewed.

Fix: Write review cache atomically (temp file + rename) so partial writes don't
corrupt state.

Clock Skew / Timestamp Issues
The shim adds timestamp: Date.now() to signals. If the user's clock changes (DST,
manual adjustment), timestamps might go backward. Does any logic depend on
monotonic timestamps?

Recommendation: Use timestamps only for debugging/display, never for
ordering/deduplication.

⏺ Overall Assessment

Grade: B+ / A-

The plan is well-structured and comprehensive, with good phase breakdown and risk
assessment. However, several implementation details need clarification:

Critical Issues (Must Fix)

Concurrent write safety → Use individual session files, not a shared JSON
Build/installation workflow → Specify how hooks find the shim executable
Signal file lifecycle → Explicitly state when/how they're deleted
Startup race condition → Start watcher before draining backlog
Important Gaps (Should Address)

Hook payload validation → Handle schema evolution gracefully
Warmup detection placement → Move to session discovery, not turn extraction
Error handling → Corrupted JSONL, missing transcripts, partial writes
Session titles → How to display sessions in UI (use lastPrompt)
Agent file clarification → Explicitly state they're ignored
Nice-to-Haves (Can Defer)

Multi-project support → Does Sage support this? Needs scoping
Migration guide → What happens to existing .sage/history/ data
Rollback procedure → How to cleanly revert if needed
Recommended Revisions

Phase 1 Changes

Write event to .sage/runtime/active-sessions.json
Write event to .sage/runtime/sessions/{sessionId}.json
Add to "Hook shim" section:

Validate hook payload schema; log warnings for unexpected fields
Specify build requirement: npm run build before configure-hooks, OR use tsx to
run TS directly
Phase 2 Changes

Add to "Create src/lib/jsonl.ts":

isWarmupSession(transcriptPath) → boolean (checks first user prompt only)
Move warmup filtering from extractTurns to listActiveSessions
Clarify: "Agent files (agent-*.jsonl) are not read; sidechain work is not
reviewed"
Specify session title source: use lastPrompt from session metadata
Phase 3 Changes

Add to "Startup bootstrap":
// Start watcher BEFORE draining to avoid race
const processed = new Set();
startWatcher((file) => {
if (!processed.has(file)) processReview(file);
});

// Drain backlog
for (const file of listSignalFiles()) {
processed.add(file);
await processReview(file);
}

Add error handling section:

Corrupted JSONL → log warning, delete signal, skip
Missing transcript → delete stale session metadata and signal
Partial review cache → use atomic writes (temp + rename)
Add to "Review orchestration":

After review, delete signal file from needs-review/
Specify signal file semantics: presence = needs review; deleted = processed
New Section: Installation & Distribution

Add before Phase 1:

Specify how Sage is installed (global CLI? npm package? local clone?)
Specify how hooks reference the shim (absolute path? $PATH? npm bin?)
Document npm run build requirement if using compiled JS
Risk Section Additions

Add to existing risks:

Concurrent hook execution → Separate files per session prevent races
Partial writes → Atomic operations throughout (signal files, review caches,
session metadata)
Hook path resolution → [depends on installation method—specify above]
Things Done Well ✅

Signal-based IPC (perfect for intermittent Sage usage)
Streaming JSONL reads (efficient for large sessions)
Catch-up on startup (naturally handles missed events)
UUID-based deduplication (robust resume handling)
No feature flag (per user's feedback)
Clear phase structure
Comprehensive test strategy
Final Recommendation

The plan is solid but needs the critical issues addressed before implementation.
Once you:

Switch to per-session files
Clarify build/install workflow
Add explicit error handling
Fix startup race condition
...you'll have a clean, production-ready design.

⏺ Would you like me to create a revised spec document with these fixes incorporated,
or do you want to discuss any of these findings first?


Thanks for the thorough review—that’s hugely helpful. I agree with the critical findings; we need to rework the plan before coding. Next steps on my side:

Rewrite the spec to use per-session metadata files (no shared JSON).
Document exactly how the hook shim is invoked (likely via npx tsx so we don’t rely on a build step), and add payload validation.
Move warmup filtering and session titles into the discovery phase (using UserPromptSubmit’s last prompt).
Clarify signal lifecycle, startup ordering (watcher before drain), and explicitly delete signals only after we atomically persist review cache updates.
Add the missing error-handling cases, note that agent files are ignored, and call out the install/distribution assumptions.
Explicitly state that timestamps are informational only (no ordering uses).
I’ll fold those changes into a revised spec now so we’re ready to implement without surprises.

Revise the spec


Replaced the migration spec with a revised version incorporating the review feedback:

Per-session metadata files (no shared JSON) and explicit atomic writes.
Hooks run via npx tsx, with payload validation and offline-friendly signal files.
Warmup filtering at session discovery, session titles from last prompt, and agent files explicitly ignored.
Watcher-before-drain flow, clear signal lifecycles, and robust error handling.
Install instructions, docs updates, and removal of SpecStory paths all spelled out.

Awesome. Lets implement the plan. Take as much time as you need. Think hard. Refer to documentation when you need to @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/documentation/claude-code-jsonl/comprehensive_jsonl_analysis.md @/Users/henryquillin/Desktop/Repos/sage/external-docs/claude-code-hooks-docs/hooks-reference.md.


Implemented the JSONL + hook pipeline end-to-end:

Added src/hooks/sageHook.ts to capture hook payloads and write per-session metadata plus review signals into .sage/runtime/.
Introduced src/lib/jsonl.ts with streaming JSONL parsing (listActiveSessions, extractTurns) and new unit test src/lib/jsonl.test.ts.
Rewrote src/lib/review.ts to consume JSONL turns, return transcript paths, and restored clarification support.
Overhauled src/ui/App.tsx for the new workflow: sessions come from hook metadata, signals queue reviews, manual sync rescans signals, and SpecStory logic is removed.
Added src/scripts/configureHooks.ts and npm run configure-hooks for installing Claude hooks; cleaned up old SpecStory modules (specstory.ts, markdown.ts, hooks.ts) and updated affected imports/tests.
Updated README, what-is-sage.md, and agents.md to document the hook/JSONL architecture instead of SpecStory.
Tests: npm run build
